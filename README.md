# FizzBuzz

This is a simple program written in C# using the .NET framework that returns the appropriate answer for a number in a game of FizzBuzz. If the number is divisible by 3, the program returns "fizz". If the number is divisible by 5, the program returns "buzz". If the number is divisble by both 3 and 5, the program returns "fizzbuzz".

In order to run this program, you must have .NET installed. This can be done by downloading the framework [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/).

Once that is installed, clone this repository by using

```
git clone https://github.com/jmcnally17/fizzbuzz
```

To run the program, simply enter

```
dotnet run
```

while in the [FizzBuzz](https://github.com/jmcnally17/fizzbuzz/FizzBuzz) directory.
